      "I am a Senior Executive – Gen AI & Product Development at Omnicom Media Group with over 6 years of experience across Generative AI, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Advanced Analytics and data-driven product development.",
      "My work spans GenAI techniques such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), multi-agent orchestration (Agenting) and Model Context Protocol (MCP), along with classical ML for finance, Industry 4.0, retail, marketing and hi-tech domains.",
      "I enjoy owning problems end-to-end: from understanding business objectives and shaping the data and modeling approach, to building scalable systems, evaluating LLMs and collaborating with cross-functional teams to put AI into real use. I also share my learnings as a speaker at forums such as TechX."
